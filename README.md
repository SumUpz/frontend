## Inspiration
As humans, our attention spans are short. We do not like reading too long of texts. Hence, let's just summarize everything

## What it does
Summarize any long or difficult texts into something short and digestable

## How we built it
The summary tool uses the API from OpenAI. The web application was created using React and Express

## Challenges we ran into
Our group was not good at making the frontend UI appealing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The application works!

## What we learned
OpenAI API has a lot of potential to solve many issues

## What's next for SumUpz
We wish to incorporate the ability to upload files and listen to sounds/music
